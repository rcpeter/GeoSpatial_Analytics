Why are we calculating the spatial weights matrix using Queen contiguity?
The spatial weights matrix is a way of representing spatial structures or relationships between different locations in the dataset. The Queen contiguity method is one of the ways to define these relationships. In Queen contiguity, two observations are considered neighbors if they share a common edge or a common vertex. This method is often used in spatial analysis because it captures more potential interactions between different locations than the alternative (Rook contiguity), which only considers locations that share an edge to be neighbors.

Why are we standardizing the population data?
Standardizing the data means transforming it to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is often done in statistical analyses to make different variables more directly comparable and to ensure that the results are not unduly influenced by the scale of the variables. In the context of spatial analysis, it can help to make the interpretation of results more intuitive, since the values represent deviations from the mean in terms of standard deviations.

Why and how are we computing the Global Moran's I?
Global Moran's I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation. Spatial autocorrelation refers to the degree to which one object is similar to other nearby objects. A positive Moran's I indicates that similar values tend to be close together, while a negative Moran's I indicates that similar values tend to be further apart. Moran's I values close to zero suggest a spatially random arrangement. Computing the Global Moran's I involves comparing each observation with every other observation in the dataset, weighted by the spatial weights matrix. This provides a single measure that summarizes the degree of spatial autocorrelation across the entire dataset.

Why and how are we computing the Local Moran's I?
While Global Moran's I gives an overall measure of spatial autocorrelation for the entire dataset, Local Moran's I provides a measure of spatial autocorrelation for each individual location. This allows you to identify specific areas of the map where high or low values cluster together (so-called hot spots or cold spots). Local Moran's I is computed in a similar way to Global Moran's I, but the calculation is done separately for each observation and its neighbors.

Why are we adding Local Moran's I values and p-values to the DataFrame?
Adding these values to the DataFrame allows you to keep track of the results of the spatial autocorrelation analysis for each location. The Local Moran's I values can be used to identify areas of significant clustering of high or low values. The p-values can be used to assess the statistical significance of these results, with lower p-values indicating a lower probability that the observed pattern could have occurred by chance.

What is Global Moran vs Local Moran and when is what used? What significance does each hold?
As explained above, Global Moran's I is a single measure that summarizes the degree of spatial autocorrelation across the entire dataset, while Local Moran's I provides a measure of spatial autocorrelation for each individual location. Global Moran's I is useful for answering questions about the overall level of spatial autocorrelation in a dataset, such as "are high values more likely to be found near other high values?" On the other hand, Local Moran's I is useful for identifying specific locations where significant spatial autocorrelation is present. The choice between Global and Local Moran's I will depend on the specific research question you are trying to answer.

What are I-values and p-value?
The I value and the p-value are statistical measures that are often used in hypothesis testing and statistical analysis.
I value: In the context of Moran's I, the "I" stands for "index". The Moran's I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation â€“ the degree to which one object is similar to other nearby objects. The I value can range from -1 (perfect dispersion) through 0 (random) to +1 (perfect correlation). A positive Moran's I indicates that similar values tend to be close together, while a negative Moran's I indicates that similar values tend to be further apart.
p-value: The p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed result could have occurred by chance under the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis for Moran's I is that the attribute being analyzed is randomly distributed among the features. If the p-value is small (typically, less than 0.05), it suggests that the observed pattern is unlikely to have occurred by chance, and we can reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness. In this case, a smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence of spatial autocorrelation.

Moran's I - Nut Shell:
1. Calculate the spatial weights matrix: This captures the spatial relationships between observations. It defines which observations are considered neighbours and assigns weights to reflect the strength of their relationship. Common approaches include distance-based weights (eg: inverse distance weighting) or contiguity-based weights (eg: defining neighbours as adjacent polygons in a map).
2. Compute the mean of the variables
3. Calcuate the deviation of each observation from the mean: For each observation, subrract the mean value from its own value. This step captures how each observation deviates from the overall average.
4. Compute the weighted sum of deviations: Multiply each observation's deviation by the deviation of its neighbors and sum these products across all observations, taking into account the weights defined in the spatial weights matrix.
5. Calculate Moran's I statistics: Computed by dividing the weighted sum of deviations by the sum of squared deviations. It can range from -1 to 1. Positive values indicate positive spatial autocorrelation (similar values tend to cluster together), and values close to zero indicate no spatial autocorrelation.
6. Assess statistical significance: Determine whether observed Moran's I value is statistically significant, it is compared to a distribution of Moran's I values generated under the assumption of spatial randomness (usually through random permutations or simulations). If the observed Moran's I is significantly different from the random distribution, it suggests the presence of spatial autocorrelation.
